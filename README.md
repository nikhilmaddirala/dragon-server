# Dragon-nixos-server
In this project I am trying out various frameworks to get a NixOS server up and running on a Cloud VPS.

Folder structure:
- Skarabox: git submodule pointing to my fork of the public skarabox project, with some modifications to make it work better for macOS.
- myskarabox: directory generated by following skarabox instructions, containing the configuration and state for your Skarabox instance.
- user-config: directory containing symlinks to my system configuration files relevant for skarabox - especially my Nix Darwin flake.
- nixos-anywhere: fork of public nixos-anywhere project.
- my-nixos-anywhere: directory generated by following nixos-anywhere instructions, containing the configuration and state for your NixOS Anywhere instance. 

## Skarabax
For developing a local fork, you need to replace the commands in the instructions with the following:

```bash
nix run /Users/nikhilmaddirala/repos/dragon-skarabox/skarabox#init -- -p /Users/nikhilmaddirala/repos/dragon-skarabox/skarabox 
```
